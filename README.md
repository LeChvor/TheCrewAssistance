# TheCrewAssistance

A simple assistant for the board game "The Crew: The Quest for Planet Nine", the purpose of which is to help players keep track of previously played cards and see what cards their teammates might still have.

## Installing
Download the app-release.apk file from the app/release folder or from v1.0.0 release  and install it.

## Plans for improvement
The app is still far from perfect. There are a few things I would like to do:
- Make it more beautiful and themed
- Add a 2-player mode
- Improve the code (I personally find it not very nice)
- Add it to Google play

I'll do it all when I'm not lazy, so I don't give any deadlines. If you want, you can help me with advice or work. I would be very grateful for help with the design for the application, because I do not know anything about it.
